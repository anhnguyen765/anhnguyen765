# Hey there! 
I'm a Computer Science student at QUT, with a passion for crafting innovative websites while delving into the depths of algorithms. But my interests don't stop there; I'm equally captivated by the power of statistics and data visualisation.

# About Me

💻 I love the challenge of full-stack development and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.\
📊 Data analysis and visualization excite me as much as coding does.\
🌱 I'm constantly learning and exploring at the intersection of technology and data analysis.\
🤝 Leadership and teamwork are integral to my personal brand, honed through volunteering and leadership roles.\
